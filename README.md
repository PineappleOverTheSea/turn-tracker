# turn-tracker
A handy tool to help you organize your battles.  
Tested on chromium only. 
## How to start:
Make sure your NPM installation is up to date. Open a terminal in the project folder and type in `npm run prod`, then follow the given local host address.
## Basic features:  
* Add creatures by inputting desired attributes and pressing the "Add creature" button. Creatures are automatically sorted by their initiative.
* "Kill" button removes the creature.
* Edit creature inside the "Currently active" field or by clicking on it in the "Coming up" line. Selected creature will appear below in the "Edit existing creature" area.
* While editing creature in either way **Initiative** changes will only be applied upon pressing enter. This is done to avoid premature rearangement of timeline elements.
* Heal / Hurt values are applied upon pressing enter.
* Round marking flag in the timeline shows the start of the next round.
* Too lazy to type? Creatures sharing the same name will be auto numbered.
* Too lazy to roll real dice? Use integrated initiative roller. **Warning:** rolling will reset the current round!
